","content":"<p>MICHAEL WOLFF\u2019S EXPLOSIVE new book on US President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and administration is due to be on Irish bookshop shelves next week, despite it being available in the US and UK today.<\/p>\n<p>Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House was due to be released in the US next Tuesday, but publishers have brought the date forward to today, after a number of extracts were made public this week, throwing the White House into chaos.<\/p>\n<p>The book quotes key Trump aides, including Steve Bannon, expressing serious doubt about his fitness for office.<\/p>\n<p>Despite its initial worldwide release of 9 January, the release of Fire and Fury has been pushed forward to today in both the US and UK to meet demand. An Amazon Kindle version of the book was made available to buy online this morning.<\/p>\n<p>While booksellers in Ireland have said that there has been unprecedented demand for Fire and Fury across the country, hard copies won\u2019t be available here until next week.<\/p>\n<p>Booksellers have acknowledged the early release of the book in the US and UK. However, they have noted even that it has been released in the UK, the earliest Ireland will be able to have the book is next week due to shipping.<\/p>\n<p>Maria Dickenson, managing director of Dubray Books, told <i>TheJournal.ie\u00a0<\/i>that they anticipate the book will be on the shelves next week.<\/p>\n<p>But she noted there are \u201clogistical practicalities\u201d that come into play, as the book has to be brought from the UK to Ireland by ferry and then needs to be distributed to bookshops.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of interest in the book, especially online,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual that something like this happens, where we don\u2019t know about a book being released until two days beforehand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s understood that Irish bookshops have been in discussions with the book\u2019s publishers to determine what sort of allocation of books they will receive. Separately, the publishers will also have to decide whether to reprint the book and by how many copies.<\/p>\n<p>Easons told <i>TheJournal.ie\u00a0<\/i>that since it was announced this morning that the book will be released in Ireland next week,\u00a0 it is has experienced an \u201cincredibly high demand\u201d from customers.<\/p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the store said that it has been inundated with calls and emails throughout the morning requesting a copy of the book.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Dubray Books, Easons is not offering a pre-order option. The spokesperson did, however, note that Easons has \u201cmade plenty of orders\u201d to ensure it can meet demand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Trump\u2019s reaction<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There has been similar excitement over the years over books like the Harry Potter series, the book Spycatcher, which was banned in the UK but sold in Ireland, and even Madonna\u2019s book Sex, which was hugely controversial at the time. But what makes Fire and Fury unusual is the fact it has had a US president trying to stop its release \u2013 leading to international attention on the release.<\/p>\n<p>Trump has been enraged by the betrayal by Bannon \u2013 a man who engineered the New York real estate mogul\u2019s link to the nationalist far right and helped create a pro-Trump media ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>Trump instructed his lawyers to try to block the release of the book, which sparked publishers to push the release date forward.<\/p>\n<p>Trump tweeted his outrage at the book\u2019s claims this morning: \u201cI authorised zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don\u2019t exist.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLook at this guy\u2019s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!\u201d Trump wrote.<\/p>\n<p>It was unclear to whom Trump was referring, with possibilities including Steve Bannon, his former chief strategist, and Steve Rubin, the president of Henry Holt and Company, which is publishing Wolff\u2019s book.<\/p>\n<p><em>With reporting by Aoife Barry and AFP.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Read:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/trump-says-book-full-of-lies-3782314-Jan2018\/\">Trump says book about his

18-year-old was excellent as West Ham ground out a draw.","content":"<p>IRELAND U21 PLAYER Declan Rice caught the eye with his performance at centre-back in West Ham\u2019s 1-1 draw <a href=\"http:\/\/www.the42.ie\/spurs-west-ham-3782294-Jan2018\/\">against Tottenham at Wembley last night<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The 18-year-old was excellent as the Hammers ground out a hard-fought draw despite relentless pressure on their goal for much of the match.<\/p>\n<p>Rice is considered one of Irish football\u2019s best young prospects \u2014 he can also play in midfield, where he has lined out for Noel King\u2019s U21 side, with the London-born player as assured on the ball as he is at defending his goal.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s rare for Irish teenagers to be given a chance to play Premier League football, but last night was Rice\u2019s 16th appearance in total for this campaign, having made his Premier League debut off the bench on the final day of last season.<\/p>\n<p>Rice has featured 13 times in the Premier League in total and previously played the full 90 minutes away to Manchester City, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.the42.ie\/declan-rice-match-of-the-day-ireland-west-ham-praise-3731185-Dec2017\/\">drawing praise for aspects of his performance<\/a> despite the Hammers ultimately losing 2-1.<\/p>\n<p>But last night was arguably his best display at senior level so far, as he helped keep some of the finest attacking players in the Premier League relatively quiet.<\/p>\n<p>His goalkeeper, Adrian, was among Rice\u2019s many admirers, afterwards <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whufc.com\/news\/articles\/2018\/january\/05-january\/adrian-we-were-compact-and-defended-team\">commenting on the official West Ham site<\/a>: \u201cI congratulated Declan after the game, because it was a big match in a massive stadium against a good team like Tottenham.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe did very well in defence, he did his job, so I have to congratulate him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]<\/p>\n<p>David Moyes was also impressed, telling Nathan Murphy of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newstalk.com\/podcasts\/Off_The_Ball\/\">Newstalk\u2019s Off the Ball<\/a> that Rice \u201cplayed really well\u201d and has a \u201cgreat attitude\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>There were plenty of people noting Rice\u2019s assured showing on Twitter too, while the player himself was suitably delighted.<\/p>\n<p><iframe

pedestrian-prioritised \u20ac10 million plaza is planned for Dublin&#8217;s College Green.","content":"<p>DUBLIN CITY COUNCIL is to review the implementation of traffic restrictions in Dublin\u2019s College Green following An Bord Plean\u00e1la\u2019s decision to cancel next week\u2019s public hearing on the planned pedestrianised area.<\/p>\n<p>The public meeting was planned for next Tuesday to discuss Dublin City Council\u2019s plans for the pedestrian-prioritised \u20ac10 million plaza at College Green. The plaza would see all traffic banned from the Dame Street and College Green area.<\/p>\n<p>However, An Bord Ple\u00e1nala <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pleanala.ie\/news\/Oral%20Hearings\/Oral%20Hearing%20UPDATE%20JA0039%2004.01.18%20%5BEN%5D.pdf\">notified relative parties<\/a> yesterday morning that the meeting would not go ahead.<\/p>\n<p>The board said that it had been postponed as a result of \u201creasons associated with public consultation and the EIA Directive\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>A newspaper notice was issued in November specifying the commencement of a 21-day public consultation period.<\/p>\n<p>However, it came to An Bord Plean\u00e1la\u2019s attention that this information was incorrect and that requirements outline that the consultation period must be 30 days.<\/p>\n<p>Dublin City Council\u2019s chief executive Owen Keegan <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CiaranCuffe\/status\/949217438293544960\">said that the council<\/a> \u201cadhered to the public consultation period advised by An Bord Plean\u00e1la\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><em>TheJournal.ie\u00a0<\/em>understands that the meeting cannot be held until Dublin City Council re-issue the amended newspaper notice and allow the 30-day period to be completed.<\/p>\n<p>It remains unclear when this notice will be issued and when the meeting will be held.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]<\/p>\n<p><strong>Prioritising pedestrians<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In light of the cancellation, Keegan said that the council will review the traffic management arrangements.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CiaranCuffe\/status\/949217438293544960\">In a letter to councillor Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe<\/a>, Keegan said that \u201cthe introduction of the Luas Cross City in December in advance of the elimination of the east and west traffic on College Green necessitated the introduction\/continuation of certain interim city centre management arrangements\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This included a \u201csignificant\u201d reduction in pedestrian priority at a number of city centre junctions, according to Keegan.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_1\"]<\/p>\n<p>In the letter to councillor Cuffe, Keegan said:<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"coloured\">\n<div>The council will have to review the interim traffic management arrangements to determine what additional changes are required, given the need to restore pedestrian priority, to cater for longer Luas vehicles and for a higher frequency of Luas Cross City services.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Plaza plans<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Dublin City Council has said that the new plaza will have the capacity to accommodate up to 15,000 people and will be fully equipped with the infrastructure required to stage later public events.<\/p>\n<p>It is intended that the plaza will be an \u201cattractive tree-lined, granite-paved 7,300 square metre space, which will facilitate major public gatherings and professional events through the city\u201d, the council said.<\/p>\n<p>It remains unclear when traffic plans will be changed and when work will begin on the plaza.<\/p>\n<p>Dublin City Council has been contacted for comment.<\/p>\n<h3>Read:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/dublin-restrictions-college-green-3694526-Nov2017\/\">Dublin traffic restrictions to remain in place until New Year as College Green

There are robust arrangements in place for victims to be informed through the Victim Contact Scheme.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Labour MP Yvette Cooper is among those to criticise Worboys\u2019 release, saying it

including raping one of them.<\/p>\n<p>Worboys, who became known as the \u2018black cab rapist\u2019, offered female passengers champagne spiked with sedatives to celebrate a fake lottery win, before attacking them.<\/p>\n<p>[embed id=\"embed_2\"]<\/p>\n<p>He was handed an indeterminate prison sentence with a minimum term of eight years to be served before the parole board could approve his release.<\/p>\n<p>Since he was jailed, police have linked him to more than 100 further rapes and sexual assaults after other alleged victims came forward.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement,\u00a0the Parole Board\u00a0said: \u201cWe can confirm that a three-member panel of the Parole Board has directed the release of Mr John Worboys, following an oral hearing.\u00a0The arrangements for Mr Worboys\u2019

their reasons immediately so both the decision and the process can be scrutinised before this man is released.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe also need to know what information and support was given to all the victims before this decision was taken.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In a series of tweets, Harwick acknowledged there is \u201ca lack transparency of Parole Board processes\u201d, adding that he
